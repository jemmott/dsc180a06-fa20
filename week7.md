# Week 7

## Reading

Give a quick read: ["Evaluating Recommendation Systems"](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/Evaluating_Recommendation_Systems.pdf) by Shani and Gunawardana. No need to memorize all the material here, but it is important to know what your options are.

## Task

For the reading response this week, ask a question (or a few) about evaluating recommendation systems. Basic questions, specific questions, whatever. I will try to answer them in class, but won't say who asked them.
