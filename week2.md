# Week 2

## Topics

This week we are going deep into the paper: "[Are We Really Making Much Progress?  A worrying Analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/are%20we%20making%20progress.pdf)" by Dacrema, Cremonesi, and Jannach.

## Tasks

Remember the steps for how I like to read academic papers?

1. Quick read of Abstract, Conclusion, Introduction (in that order).
2. Careful read of the abstract, making sure you really understand it.  You may need to look up terms. This read takes a long time. This is when I decide if a paper is "worth it".
3. Quick read of the paper, keeping a list of terms & concepts to look up.
4. Look up the stuff you didn't know.
5. Do a careful read of the paper, spending the time to really understand.

This week you should complete steps 4 & 5 from the previous list.

You might want to look at the code for the paper: [here](https://github.com/MaurizioFD/RecSys2019_DeepLearning_Evaluation), along with some detailed documentation and links to additional info about baselines, parameter tuning, etc.

The replication assignment for the quarter is to adapt that baseline code (with citations!) in a way that will be helpful to you. I would like it if you try to replicate a paper that the authors didn't do.

## Questions

- For each of the papers that the authors reproduced, I want you to summarize in just a few words what the result was.  Ideally this will be in simple, clear language rather than the stiff and formal language of academic papers!
- It is totally ok and understandable if you don't totally understand everything in the paper.  Keep a list of the topics you are still confused about, and ask about them in discussion. Remember, questions are how this class will work!
