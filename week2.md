# Week 2

## Topics

## Reading

The paper that we will be mainly working with this quarter is "[Are We Really Making Much Progress?  A worrying Analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/are%20we%20making%20progress.pdf)" by Dacrema, Cremonesi, and Jannach.

Before the first meeting on October 7th, you should try to read the paper.  The goal is to give it a quick read.  Later you will make sure you understand all the details, but the goal in the first pass is to make sure you understand the argument the authors are making and the way that they are reasoning to support it.

I like to read academic papers in the following order:

1. Quick read of Abstract, Conclusion, Introduction (in that order).
2. Careful read of the abstract, making sure you really understand it.  You may need to look up terms. This read takes a long time. This is when I decide if a paper is "worth it".
3. Quick read of the paper, keeping a list of terms & concepts to look up.
4. Look up the stuff you didn't know.
5. Do a careful read of the paper, spending the time to really understand.

For the first class I am asking you to do steps 1-3.
