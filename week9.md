# Week 9

## Reading

Listen to [Rabbit Hole](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/podcasts/rabbit-hole-internet-youtube-virus.html) episodes 1-4.  You can also listen wherever you get podcasts. Episodes 5-8 are also interesting, but don't focus as directly on recommender systems, and so aren't assigned.

Reach chapter 3 of Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction" [here](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/Weapons-of-Math-Destruction-Cathy-ONeil-pages-deleted.pdf).  I recommend reading the whole book - I don't agree with everything in it, but it is on my [list of books I like](https://github.com/jemmott/books).

## Optional Reading

Read about [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)

[Ethics and Data Science](https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/0636920203964/) is a great book!  Short, free, and focused on understanding the problem and solutions.  Look, I get that you are busy right now.  Why don't you bookmark this for when you are bored over break?

[Recommender systems and their ethical challenges](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/RecommenderSystemsAndTheirEthics.pdf) is a highly technical paper that goes into some detail on what can go wrong specifically with recommender systems.

## Questions

1. For a recommender system you are thinking about building next quarter, give several examples of how the recommendations might be inconsistent across demographic groups.  For example, online shopping recommendations might be more accurate because rich people buy more stuff, so there is more data. These can be hypothetical.
2. For each example above, describe in a sentence or two how you might test for disparate impact, how you might check if it is a problem, or how you might fix it.
