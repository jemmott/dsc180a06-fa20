# Week 9

## Topics

## Reading

Listen to [Rabbit Hole](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/podcasts/rabbit-hole-internet-youtube-virus.html) episodes 1-4.  You can also listen wherever you get podcasts. Episodes 5-8 are also interesting, but don't focus as directly on recommender systems, and so aren't assigned.

Read about [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)

Optional: [Recommender systems and their ethical challenges](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/RecommenderSystemsAndTheirEthics.pdf)
