# Recommender Systems Capstone

## About this course

Welcome to UC San Diego's Data Science Capstone in Recommender Systems! Officially this is "DSC-180 A Section A06" for Fall, 2020. 

This quarter we will replicate a recent paper about, well, replication failures. Read more in the [schedule](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/schedule.md).

The quarter will end with a proposal for your capstone project. My only real rule about this is that it must be a recommender system that *actually works*.

"Actually works", in this context, means that you are able to validate that it provides humans real value.  This probably means it lives on the internet, and does something useful or brings people joy.

## COVID-19 Notes

First, your top priority right now should be making sure you stay safe and healthy.  Your second priority should be making sure your family, friends, and community are safe and healthy.  I hope that together we can learn some data science too, but never at the cost of health or safety.

Second, this class will be entirely remote - no in-person anything. It is going to be a bit rough, and we will all make mistakes.  I encourage you to be generous and forgiving, but also to give clear and frequent feedback.  I will try to do the same.

Third, I want to recognize that this is going to be hard for you.  There are students in this class that are all over the world, that don't have access to good computers, reliable internet, and who are suddenly working in less-than-optimal conditions.  There is also the stress of living during a global pandemic, social unrest and a major election!  Personally, I know I am not doing my best work right now because I am distracted and worried.  Please reach out if there is anything I can do to help you in this class.  I want you all to succeed.

## Academic Integrity

For this class, the key to academic integrity is accurately representing the status and authorship of your work. I strongly encourage you to read the official UCSD policy on integrity of scholarship.

## Diversity and Inclusion

I am committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our diversity of perspectives, experiences and identities. You, as a student in this course, are also responsible for maintaining an environment where your fellow students feel safe and respected.

In my opinion, the key to this is recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of every person. If there is a way you could feel more included please let me know via email.
