# Week 3

## Topics

This week we will learn a little about real-world recommender systems.

## Reading

Read [this brief article about the New York Times recommender](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/building-the-next-new-york-times-recommendation-engine/).

## Tasks

Replication Checkpoint #1 due next week (week 4), so start thinking about that.

I would really like it if you tried to reproduce a paper that isn't one of the ones covered in "[Are We Really Making Much Progress?  A worrying Analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/are%20we%20making%20progress.pdf)" by Dacrema, Cremonesi, and Jannach.  Let me know if you want help identifying a candidate paper. There is some discussion going on in the #result-replication slack channel.

## Questions

- Remember back to week 1, when you described what made you like or not like various automated recommendations.  When you read through the article about the NYT recommender, take note of all of the problems that they are trying to address.  Do those match your list?  How are they different?

This is a little abstract, so an example might help.  If you didn't like a movie recommendation because you had already watched it, then does the NYT system solve that?  Could it?
