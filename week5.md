# Week 5

## Reading

Read the first two chapters of "Practical Recommender Systems" by Kim Falk.

I uploaded a pdf of the first two chapters [here](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/Practical.Recommender.Systems%20ch%201-2.pdf), but I strongly recommend that you buy the book, and read (or at least skim) it all.  I think it will help you a ton when you go to, you know, actually build one of these things.

Ok, I get that you aren't going to read the whole thing.  But at least check out the table of contents [here](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-recommender-systems).  You know you want that around as a reference!

## Questions

For the reading response this week I want you pick a recommender system that exists, and think carefully about the categories in section 1.2:

1. Domain
2. Purpose
3. Context
4. Personalization Level
5. Whose opinions
6. Privacy and trustworthiness
7. Interface
8. Algorithms

Obviously there will be guesswork involved - you don't know what is going on behind the scenes.  But I want you to make your best guess and try to be crisp.

I would prefer that you try this on a different recommender than you have looked at in the past, and one we don't talk about often in class.  Remember that automated recommendations are everywhere, from your social media feed to dating apps to recommended emoji in your keyboard to classics like retail.  Open your phone and look at those icons - probably most of them have more than one recommender!
