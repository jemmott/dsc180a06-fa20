## Background

Some of you haven't studied recommender systems before.  That's ok!  But it does mean you will need to spend some extra time at the beginning of the quarter learning some background.

Here are some resources that you might find helpful:

- UCSD's [CSE158: "Web Mining and Recommender Systems"](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) with McAuley. If you haven't taken this class, you might see if you can get in?  If not, notes and such from previous versions are online.
- Google's "[Recommendation Systems"](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/) course is free, and takes about four hours to complete. 
- The book "[Practical Recommender Systems"]() by Falk is more approachable, and does a good job discussing the pitfalls that happen in real-world applications. I don't love the informal tone, and the code samples aren't my favorite, but the advice is solid.
- ["Recommender Systems: The Textbook" by Aggarwal](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319296579) is a nice, fairly complete and technical reference. I often pick it up when I am stuck.

## Week 1

The paper that we will be mainly working with this quarter is "[Are We Really Making Much Progress?  A worrying Analysis of Recent Neural Recommendation Approaches](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/are%20we%20making%20progress.pdf)" by Dacrema, Cremonesi, and Jannach.

## Week 6

Give a quick read: ["Evaluating Recommendation Systems"](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/Evaluating_Recommendation_Systems.pdf) by Shani and Gunawardana. No need to memorize all the material here, but it is important to know what your options are.

## Week 7

Listen to [Rabbit Hole](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/podcasts/rabbit-hole-internet-youtube-virus.html) episodes 1-4.  You can also listen wherever you get podcasts. Episodes 5-8 are also interesting, but don't focus as directly on recommender systems, and so aren't assigned.

Optional: ethics paper
