# Week 6

Our regular class meeting on week 6 falls on a holiday, but I still have some things I want to share with you that I think you will like!

## Reading

If you don't know [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) you should check out a few of their posts.  I think they do an exceptional job at telling stories with data - clear, interactive, pretty, and entertaining.

Luckily for you, they put together descriptions of how they do it!  I recommend skipping or skimming part 1, since it is about data manipulation which you are all good at already.  Part 2 is design, and part 3 is storytelling.  There are lots of links for when you want to go deeper into a topic.

[Part 1: Working with Data](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-1/)
[Part 2: Design](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2/)
[Part 3: Storytelling](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-3/)

I also encourage you to check out [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) for prototyping.  It probably won't be your final UI, but it is so easy - I have been loving it lately.  You can make the UI and deploy in like ten lines of code!

## Questions

For the reading submission this week, I want you to share one of two things:

A. Share a resource you like for front-end / UI / UX / design.  This could be a blog post or a book or a library or whatever.  I will compile these and share them with the class.

-or-

B. Write a paragraph about how storytelling, as described in the pudding article, relates to recommenders.  What is similar, and what is different?
