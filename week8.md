## Reading

Reach chapter 3 of Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction" [here](https://github.com/jemmott/dsc180a06-fa20/blob/master/papers/Weapons-of-Math-Destruction-Cathy-ONeil-pages-deleted.pdf).  I recommend reading the whole book - I don't agree with everything in it, but it is on my [list of books I like](https://github.com/jemmott/books).
